# React DraftJS Autocomplete Challenge

This project demonstrates an autocomplete editor built with React and DraftJS. The editor allows users to type hashtags, mentions, and custom strings, providing suggestions as they type. It includes a fully functioning autocomplete dropdown and supports text styling features like bold, italic, underline, and code.

## Features:
- Autocomplete suggestions for hashtags (`#`), mentions (`@`), and custom tags (`<>`).
- Support for inline text styling such as **bold**, *italic*, and `monospace`.
- Dynamic autocomplete updates based on the user input.
- React components for both block and inline styling controls.
